we have nothing except getflag function so lets hack it
it is protected with ptrace so first of all
gdb ./level14
disas main
catch syscall ptrace
commands 1
set $eax=0
continue
end
then lets find the place where the uid comparison occures:
b getuid
step
the UID we need can be found with id flag14 in shell - it is 3014
info registers
set $eax=3014
c
